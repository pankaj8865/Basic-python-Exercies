# Basic-python-Exercies
basic exercises a begineer can go through in python

1.Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

2.Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

3.Take a list, say for example this one:

	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:
    Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
    
4.Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
